== [Boost split build of Boost.org libraries] ==

=== What the ... happened? ===

 * code moved from ebuild to eclasses
 * multiple ebuilds as descriptors for eclasses
 * created tarball for generic diff files
 * no eselect code necessary
 * *not* supported is unversioned libraries in LIBDIR with SLOTing => automagic is evil(tm)

=== What to do before? ===

Remove boost & eselect-boost and its left-overs located at:

{{{
/usr/include/boost
/usr/lib/libboost_*
}}}

Check the system for boost libraries used:

{{{
# libraries
for f in $(find /usr/lib/ -type f -name '*.so*'); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done

# binaries
for f in $(find /usr/bin/ -type f -perm -111); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done

# binaries under LIBDIR
for f in $(find /usr/lib/ -type f -perm -111 ! -name '*.so*'); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done
}}}

=== How to fix packages from Gentoo repository? ===

 * add 'boost-utils' to 'inherit' at the top of the ebuild
 * add this line to src_configure before configure:
( it checks for the respective library path of the boost-headers version! )
