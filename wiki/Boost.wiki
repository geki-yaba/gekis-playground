== [Boost split build of Boost.org libraries] ==

=== What the ... happened? ===

 * code moved from ebuilds to eclasses
 * created tarball for generic diff files
 * no eselect code necessary
 * *not* supported is unversioned libraries in LIBDIR with SLOTing => automagic is evil(tm)

=== What to do before? ===

Remove boost & eselect-boost and its left-overs located at:

{{{
/usr/include/boost
/usr/lib/libboost_*
}}}

Check the system for boost libraries used:

{{{
# libraries
for f in $(find /usr/lib/ -type f -name '*.so*'); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done

# binaries
for f in $(find /usr/bin/ -type f -perm -111); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done

# binaries under LIBDIR
for f in $(find /usr/lib/ -type f -perm -111 ! -name '*.so*'); do echo $f; ldd $f | grep boost; done
}}}

=== What now? ===

Install _dev-libs/boost_ with its respective useflags!

=== How to fix packages from Gentoo repository? ===

 * copy the boost-utils.eclass to the repository which holds the edited ebuild ( portage feature )
 * add 'boost-utils' to 'inherit' at the top of the ebuild
 * add this line to src_configure before configure:

{{{
boost-utils_add_paths
}}}
_It checks for the respective library path of the boost-headers version!_

_... or ..._

 * fix configure options in ebuilds like the example of mkvtoolnix:

http://code.google.com/p/gekis-playground/source/browse/trunk/media-video/mkvtoolnix/mkvtoolnix-4.9.1.ebuild#61

_... or ..._

 * cmake based builds should use FindBoost.cmake properly, works then!

 * cmake based builds with useflag`[-threads]` need to add a cmake define in /etc/make.conf
