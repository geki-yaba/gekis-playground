= Introduction =

Welcome to my hacking playground of Gentoo Linux distribution.


= Details =

I just hack on interesting stuff for me.<br>
Sometimes it may happen others see it needful, too.

Following are some notes to the packages of mine.


= Gentoo Packages =

== LibreOffice ==

Be _libre_, or so.

== [Boost split build of Boost.org libraries] ==

What to say; state-of-the-art, keep simple and the ptr_container and circular_buffer relief of pain somewhat.

== Jemalloc ==

A general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation.

Not much to say but it is said to reduce memory fragmentation and utilization with some programs.

Anything more to add? Tell me!
